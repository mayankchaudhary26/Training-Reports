# What are neural networks?


Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural net-works (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learn-ing algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the net-work.
